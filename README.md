# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Projects

This is my project submissions for [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program started in May 2015.

## Project 1: [Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](./Test a Perceptual Phenomenon/)

- Analyzed the Stroop effect using descriptive statistics to prove an intuition about the data.
- Included a very detailed explanation on the statistical tests used in the analysis.

## Project 2: [Analysing The NYC Subway Dataset](./New York Subway/Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset.md)

- Used a couple of statistical tools to study whether the ridership of New York Subway increases in rainy days.
- Issues of multicollinearity were also investigated and analyzed.


## Project 3: [Wrangle OpenStreetMaps Data](./OpenStreetMap/Data Wrangle OpenStreetMaps Data.ipynb)

- Wrangled and analyzed OpenStreetMaps data in Greater London area with MongoDB.
- Validated the postcodes in this dataset and analysed a few features in this dataset, including user contributions, amenities and transportation network.


## Project 4: [Explore and Summarize Data](./Explore and Summarize Data/README.md)

- Explored a courses statistics dataset released by edX, one of the biggest MOOC platform.
- Investigated the correlations between the registrants' information and their performances in the courses.

## Project 5: [Identifying Fraud from Enron Email](./Identifying Fraud from Enron Email/)

- Identify person of interest (poi) in Enron scandal from a given dataset with a number of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing methods.
