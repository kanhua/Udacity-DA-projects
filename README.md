# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Projects

This is my project submissions for [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program started in May 2015.


## Project 2: [Analysing The NYC Subway Dataset](./New York Subway/Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset.md)

This project uses a couple of statistical tools to study whether the ridership of New York Subway increases in rainy days. Apart from the specification required by the course, issues of multicollinearity were also investigated and analyzed.


## Project 3: [Data Wrangle OpenStreetMaps Data](./OpenStreetMap/Data Wrangle OpenStreetMaps Data.ipynb)

This project wrangles and analyzes OpenStreetMaps data in Greater London area with MongoDB. We validated the postcodes in this dataset and analysed a few features in this dataset, including user contributions, amenities and transportation network.


## Project 4: [Explore and Summarize Data](./Explore and Summarize Data/README.md)

We explored a courses statistics dataset released by edX, one of the biggest MOOC platform. This project investigated the correlations between the registrants' information and their performances in the courses. More than 20 figures was included in the project file to visulize those features in the dataset. The main tool for this study is R and ggplot.
